## Summary

Full-stack data scientist interested in anything data-related. Basically how to leverage data to build cool things and entertain myself.

Particularly interested in applications of theory, building things end-to-end, and doing stuf from scratch. Preferably projects that combine 2/3 of these things.

## Repositories

They are a bit messy due to the nature of serving different purposes, being created at different times, written in different languages, etc. They come in the following types:

* _Recent Projects_. Stand-alone projects, mostly ML stuff. Name should be lower case separated by dashes, like-this. Should be largely simple and well-structured.
* _Legacy Projects_. Random repositories where I have dumped code I wrote before I started using GitHub. Project name in CamelCase, varying degree of just about everything in these. Largely not structured in a sensible way.
* _Other_. Random repos with no common thread.
  * Haydn-Martin.github.io - new DS blog
  * Perpetual_Prudence - old WordPress personal finance/investing blog custom code and analysis in R
  * Prob_Stat_ML - playign around with theory implementation in python and R
* _Private_. Either containing PI, not ready, or top secret for undisclosed reasons. The less said about these the better...
