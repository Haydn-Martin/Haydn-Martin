## Summary

Full-stack data scientist interested in anything data-related. Basically how to leverage data to build cool things and entertain myself.

Particularly interested in applications of theory, building things end-to-end, and doing stuf from scratch. Preferably projects that combine 2/3 of these things.

## Repositories

They are a bit messy due to the nature of serving different purposes, being created at different times, written in different languages, etc. They come in the following types:

* _Recent Projects_. Stand-alone projects, mostly ML stuff. Name should be lower case separated by dashes, like-this. Should be largely simple and well-structured.
* _Legacy Projects_. Random repositories where I have dumped code I wrote before I started using GitHub. Project name in CamelCase, varying degree of just about everything in these. Largely not structured in a sensible way.
* _Other_. Random repos with no common thread.
  * Haydn-Martin.github.io - new DS blog
  * Perpetual_Prudence - old WordPress personal finance/investing blog custom code and analysis in R
  * Prob_Stat_ML - playign around with theory implementation in python and R
* _Private_. Either containing PI, not ready, or top secret for undisclosed reasons. The less said about these the better...

## Future Project Ideas

* **Automation**
  * _Job Search_. Automate as many steps as possible in the job search process.
    * Tools: Google APIs, job boards, LinkedIn scraping, etc.   
  * _Date Venue Search_. Tool to search date venues in London depends on input parameters.
* **Data Engineering**
  * _Venture Capital DB_. Combine various sources together to form a VC DB/CRM tool.
  * _UK Climate Dashboard_. Combine various sources together to form a UK climate dashboard.
* **Machine Learning**
  * _Crypto Virality Classification_. Predict if a new token will be successful. 
  * _Macro Prediction‚ùì_. Need to think of an application...
  * _Will I Like This Song Classification_. Use Liked songs to predict if I will like a given song.
    * Motivation: Spotify's algorithm has recency bias. If I listen to afrobeats for a week suddenly my DW is all afrobeats.
  * _Upcoming Events Classification_. Classify events from Eventbrite into those I would be interested in and not.
* **LLM Wrappers**
  * _Word Replacer_. Find a more appropriate word given an input sentance and replace word.
* **Implementing Theory**
* **Fun**
  * _Childhood Films Quiz_. Generate 10 random questions about my favourite childhood films.
    * Films
      * Harry Potter
      * LOTR
      * Star Wars Prequels
